The first thing you can do is create repositories, which are used to store code. Another thing you can do is cloning your repositories, which provide a replication for your code. You can also commit which just saves your work and provides the history of changes made throughout your code. The great thing about GitHub is that it allows potential employers to see your projects. It also provides coders with the opportunity to work with other people on projects. A video will be provided which will provide an in-depth tutorial of GitHub.
