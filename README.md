## How to install WebStorm and Git
### Installing WebStorm
- To install WebStorm you have to go to: jetbrains.com. Log on to JetBrains. If you don't have an account, you may create a new account. Once you log into your account, you have to search for WebStorm. You can use the search bar icon to find the WebStorm application. You should see a download button when you find WebStorm (click on it to download WebStorm). Before downloading the application, if you are a student at a university, you can have a student license to use WebStorm for free. All you need to do is enter your university email to be qualified for the license. Once you download WebStorm, you need to follow the instructions when you boot up WebStorm for the first time. After those instructions are completed, you can freely use WebStorm.
### Installing Git
- Installing Git on the other hand is pretty straightforward. Go to the Git website and install Git on your device whether it's a mac, windows, or Linux. There are multiple Gits to download but choose the one that you would like to download. After that follow the instructions on how to set up Git. Once you finish the instructions, Git should be installed on your device.

## Things you can do on GitHub and WebStorm
### Setup/uses for GitHub
- Go to github.com. Once you're on the site create a GitHub account. After creating an account, you can see a lot of things on GitHub. You're probably wondering what you can do on GitHub. The first thing you can do is create repositories, which are used to store code. Another thing you can do is cloning your repositories, which provide a replication for your code. You can also commit which just saves your work and provides the history of changes made throughout your code. The great thing about GitHub is that it allows potential employers to see your projects. It also provides coders with the opportunity to work with other people on projects. A video will be provided which will provide an in-depth tutorial of GitHub.
### Uses for WebStorm
- Assuming you have downloaded WebStorm, there are many things you can do. You can create a repository on WebStorm, or you can import a repository from GitHub. Another thing that you can do is create a WebStorm file, where you can write HTML code. A great feature is that you can add files to Git. You can also commit changes which save your work and provide a history of changes made on your file. It's better to practice WebStorm, so you can get used to the features.
