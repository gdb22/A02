## How to install WebStorm and Git
### Installing WebStorm
- To install WebStorm you have to go to: jetbrains.com. Log on to JetBrains. If you don't have an account, you may create a new account. Once you log into your account, you have to search for WebStorm. You can use the search bar icon to find the WebStorm application. You should see a download button when you find WebStorm (click on it to download WebStorm). Before downloading the application, if you are a student at a university, you can have a student license to use WebStorm for free. All you need to do is enter your university email to be qualified for the license. Once you download WebStorm, you need to follow the instructions when you boot up WebStorm for the first time. After those instructions are completed, you can freely use WebStorm.
### Installing Git
- Installing Git on the other hand is pretty straightforward. Go to the Git website and install Git on your device whether it's a mac, windows, or Linux. There are multiple Gits to download but choose the one that you would like to download. After that follow the instructions on how to set up Git. Once you finish the instructions, Git should be installed on your device.
